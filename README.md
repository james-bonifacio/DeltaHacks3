RLSolutions HealthCare Nutrition and Diet Mobile App:

Mission: To innovate a new way of incentivising users to follow diet and nutrition plans as laid out by their nutritionists/doctors.

Description: 
We present a typical system of entering in daily intake amounts of different foods and pull from a database that holds all the nutritional information of said food item. Every time you enter meal information and the daily total is within an acceptable range, then you earn a set amount of points for the day. If you meet this total for consecutive days, we'll increase the multiplier which will earn you more points. If you miss your target, your points multiplier will decrease. Miss a day of logging, and you'll break your streak and set your multiplier back down to 1.
